# Fractal Tree

## Gameplan

Develop a Java Swing application that will generate a fractal tree from a set of customizable parameters.

Customizable parameters to be included are as follows:

- **Branching Factor** (number of new branches created at a split)
- **Tree Depth** (maximum branches for any given path in the tree)
- **Split Angle** (determines whether a tree will lean right or left)
- **Branching Angle** (angle between any 2 adjacent branches in a split)
- **Branch Reduction Rate** (rate at which branch length will decrease per split)
- **Stroke Weight** (thickness of the branches)
- **Stroke Shrink Rate** (rate at which stroke weight will decrease per split)

Stretch features include:

- Customizable color pattern for branches
- Options to add variance in some of the parameters (i.e. branching factor with a range of 2-4)
- Ability to generate a tree with random settings
- Ability to save a generated tree as an image

| 3/31  | Program can generate a basic fractal tree with no customizability      |
| 4/14  | Program is able to generate fractal trees from customizable parameters |
| 4/23  | Program is in working state with any additional features implemented   |
